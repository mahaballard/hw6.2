<h1>Homework 6: Census data ratios and categories </h1>
<h3>In this assignment, I created a choropleth of the percentage of females whose poverty status is determined in California
    out of the total population whose proverty status is determined in California in 2019. Below are three maps using different classifications.

    I created this ratio to see if there was a significant difference between the number of men and women with determined
    poverty statuses. I found that there is not a large difference and that just as many men have a determined poverty status.
