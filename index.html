<h1>Homework 6: Census data ratios and categories </h1>
<h3>In this assignment, I created a choropleth to represent the ratio between TOTAL_FEM_POP to TOTAL_POP in California in 2019. 

    I created this ratio to see if there was a significant difference between the number of men and women with determined
    poverty statuses. I found that there is not a large difference and that just as many men have a determined poverty status.

    Below are three maps using different classifications.
